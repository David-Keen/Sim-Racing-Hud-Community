# Introduction

This is a open-source SIM racing dashboard application for the Mobile platform. It will also work along side a dashboard steering wheel which will run on the Linux platform. The [steering wheel (seporate project)](https://github.com/David-Keen/Thrustmaster-ESP) will be powered with an ESP32 chip.

More information will be released as the project starts.
